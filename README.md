## _**GonzaloLawDashboard**_

## About

Project is divided into two codebases: **client** and **server**. I want to rename these to frontend and backend, but this will be a future change. For now, we'll be splitting our tasks into backend and frontend tasks.

The about section is still in progress. I haven't had much time to add more documentation on what the dashboard is, but feel free to add the documentation. Everyone in the team should feel free/responsible to document the project.

## Formatting

Still in-progress, haven't had much time to add to this section. However, it is important we all stick to one style so we are all able to read our code easily. We will be using [prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html), a code formatter tool. Once you install it, run it from the main directory using this command:

`prettier --write '**/*.js`

This will format your code to use proper Javascript/HTML styling. Also, do any development in a separate branch. For example, if I am developing the authentication logic in the backend, I will develop it in the branch **PE_authentication_in_backend** (my initials, PE, and brief description of what the branch contains)


## Frontend

I added Semantic UI to the Frontend, a CSS styling library. This will help you make your frontend components a lot more stylish. Please read the documentation to learn how to use it in React: https://react.semantic-ui.com/
