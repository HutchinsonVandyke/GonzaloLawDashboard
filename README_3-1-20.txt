Most of my changes are solely in the Components folder but I have also added a CSS
folder with some classes that I've used. The point of this is to detail some ideas
and plans I have and maybe get some feedback.

Calendar - I am of course planning on adding a '+' similar to that of the clientlist
so that the admin can add an appointment or the client themselves can schedule or suggest
an appointment themselves.

Client List - Just a little mock up of something that might work which is the list and
the add button that could prompt a popup with an intake form of sorts. I made something
very general that you can checkout by just pressing the button yourself. I am either thinking about making
the 'view' produce a dropdown that hides the rest of the clients or produces a popup with
all their relevant info, let me know what you guys think because I wanna hop on that soon.

To-do List - This will ideally just be a lot of headers thta could make a drop drop
but I'm not sure. Haven't put too much thought into it. I think the to do list should also be broken
down into some sub categories where appointments will show up right here and x other thing
will be in another lil drop down something?
